# Introduction
This is the ninth course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, Developing Data Products. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics.

# Course Description
A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.
